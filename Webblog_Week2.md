In this week, the topic of our readings is center around the derivation of the World Wide Web ( WWW ). I found two of the readings that are particular interesting.

**What is hypertext**



The paper [What is Hypertext](http://www.hyperfiction.org/texts/whatHypertextIs.pdf) analyzed the starting point for the definition of hypertext which was provided by Theodor Holm Nelson. There were different viewpoints toward the definition of hypertext from different communities. Literacy community focus on the definition on the link, where Marie-Laure Ryan explained that hypertext is a filed that users can click to unfold informations ( usually a hyperlink ). But Computer Science community definition is somewhat different, they think the interpretation of links from literary community miss some profound aspects of "hypertext", computer science community views hypertext as association that can build knowledge. To my understanding of the paper, the author believed although their were different view points towards the definition of hypertext from different communities, there should be a starting points where hypertext was coined with where later on those communities branched out further understanding on the term differently and in the case for hypertext, the term was coined by Theodor Holm Nelson. Ted Nelson developed the term " hypertext","hypermedia" and hyperfilm simultaneously: He defined "hypertext" as a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that in could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper.

**The Original Proposal of the WWW**

One of the other paper that I found to be interesting was the [original proposal of the WWW](http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1405411/files/ARCH-WWW-4-010.pdf) . The idea of having a world wild website is proposed by Tim Bemers-Lee. 

There were limitations of the available systems before the invention of WWW. Tree structure and keywords searching are the most common structure and method used for organize information. The limitation of tree structure is that not all relations can be simply modeled with a a tree structure. And the limitation of keyword searching is that people don't often come up with the exact same word to express the same things, thus information can't be shared in the way when they have to be identified by using the same keyword.

One point that he brought up when introducing what the system would be look like that I thought was interesting is that: there should be an interface separating user and machine which reminds me of the importance in computer science fields of having abstraction and interfaces. I am taking Operating System currently, without the coordination by the operating system, it's impossible for computers to deliver services and applications that perform well that are well accepted and used by users such as web browsing, gaming applications etc. Two important things make those applications become popular and successful, one is the abstraction provided by the operating system that virtualizes the CPU usage and RAM limitations, the other is by creating the interface (API) between hardware and developers so that developers can focus on the high level design of the system and applications without worrying about the cumbersome details of how hardware and computer architecture work together.  I found it fascinating when the moment I realized that the idea of interface not only work well on the creation of WWW but also work well on operating systems design and other applications that relates to computer science field.
